Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a full stack dev. I have a passion for learning and love solving complex problems.
My current project is building a basic game of Solitaire - which I actually play almost every day so I'm looking forward to playing my own version!

ðŸ‘¯ Once I complete my coding bootcamp, my wife and I are going to build an app. She is a product manager and designer, so between the two of us, we have a full team at home. 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for feedback and ways to improve myself so feel free to reach out!
